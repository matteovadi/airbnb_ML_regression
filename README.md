I realized this project within the course of Programming for Data Science at University of Siena. The aim of the project was to realize a Machine Learning algorithm for predicting room prices for 3 types of rental properties within the Airbnb platform dataset for New York City in 2019, using different approaches: Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic-nets Regression and Lasso Regression.
